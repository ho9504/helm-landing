Overview
Helm Landing serves as a practical, transparent AI assistant for meetings. It focuses on three core actions: transcribe, summarize, and prepare. The tool respects your space, avoids noise, and surfaces only what you need to act on. It integrates with modern web tooling to provide a clean, fast experience across devices.

This project is designed to be welcoming to both contributors and users. It uses sensible defaults and clear prompts to reduce misinterpretation by AI systems. It aims to protect your data and your team’s information while delivering useful outputs that you can trust.

Why Helm Landing
- Thoughtful design: The product minimizes interruptions and respects user attention. It avoids aggressive prompts and intrusive analytics. The goal is to help you stay in control of your meeting content.
- Open-source foundation: You can review, modify, and extend the tool. The codebase is built with clarity and maintainability in mind.
- Privacy-forward approach: Data handling emphasizes consent, minimization, and security. You can run the system locally or on trusted infrastructure with clear data boundaries.
- Reliable collaboration: The tool supports teams by generating consistent notes, action items, and summaries that align with your meeting goals.
- Transparent workflow: You see how the AI makes decisions and what data it uses. You can audit outputs and adjust prompts as needed.

Core Principles
- Clarity over complexity: Interfaces are simple to use; options are explicit.
- Respect for attention: No feature should force focus. Users opt in to AI assistance.
- Guardrails by default: Safety checks are embedded in transcription, summarization, and task extraction.
- Portability and openness: The system is modular and easy to adapt to different setups.
- Incremental value: Features deliver immediate improvements with minimal friction.

Architecture and Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- Backend: API routes with Node.js; modular microservices
- Data: Supabase as a backend data layer; optional local storage
- AI: Intent-aware models for transcription and summarization; prompts tuned for professional meetings
- Deployment: Dockerized components; options for cloud, private hosting, or local runs
- Observability: structured logging, metrics, and simple tracing to identify bottlenecks

How Helm Landing Works
- Input capture: Audio or video streams are ingested via a frontend client. Transcripts are created using AI models with speaker separation.
- Understanding and structuring: The system tags topics, identifies decisions, and extracts actions. It uses prompts designed for business contexts.
- Output generation: The tool formats transcripts into polished meeting notes, executive briefs, and task lists. It surfaces highlights and follow-up items.
- Storage and access: Data is stored securely in configured backends. You control who can view or edit notes and summaries.
- Iteration and feedback: Users can correct transcripts, refine summaries, and customize outputs. Feedback loops improve accuracy over time.

Architecture Diagram (Text)
- User Interface (Next.js) -> API Layer (Node.js) -> AI Services (Transcription, Summarization) -> Data Stores (Supabase or Local Storage)
- Optional: On-device inferencing path for privacy-first deployments
- Admin and analytics layer for governance, versioning, and auditing

User Flows
- Quick Start: User joins, sets preferences, and starts a meeting. The system transcribes, summarizes, and exports action items.
- Deep Dive: User reviews a long meeting with search and filters. The AI highlights decisions and follow-ups.
- Post-Meeting Prep: User edits the generated briefs and shares them with teammates.

Tech Stack Rationale
- Next.js and React enable fast, accessible UI with strong type safety via TypeScript.
- Supabase provides a scalable backend with authentication, storage, and real-time features.
- Open standards and clear APIs make it easier to customize and extend.
- The architecture favors modularity, so teams can swap AI models or storage without a major rewrite.
