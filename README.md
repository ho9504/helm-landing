# Helm | Own Your Workflow


Helm is the AI meeting assistant for thoughtful professionals, built on a foundation of transparency and respect for your data. We're creating a tool that works **for** you, not against you.

Our mission is to give professionals **sovereignty over their time, attention, and data.**
